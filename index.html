title: CyberPoint Labs on Security
---


<p>CyberPoint Labs is an industrial research and development activity -- advancing the discipline of cyber security by attacking and solving the hard problems of the field. It performs cutting-edge research in cyber security, develops new technologies and product prototypes, invents new tools and techniques, and coordinates with academic and open source researchers. 

<p>We are excited to share with the open source
community libraries and technologies we have developed that we think
might be useful for malware analysis, software reverse code engineering,
vulnerability discovery, and software security.  We are commited to advancing state of the art research in modeling cyber risk, detecting novel and sophisticated threats, and automating network analysis.

<p>Our blog is focused on topics on software and system security, best
practices, emerging threats, data science, machine learning,
cryptography, software reverse code engineering, malware analysis, and
network analysis.
